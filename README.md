MetaModels demo website install environment
===========================================

This is the install environment for the demo websites of the [MetaModels](https://github.com/MetaModels) project.

So how to get a demo?
-----------------------

Have a look at the repositories of the MetaModels project.

The demo website repositories start with "demo-" and may be installed via composer.

You can also have a look at the [official website](http://now.metamodel.me) and download a demo from there.
